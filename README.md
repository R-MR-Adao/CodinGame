Here is a simple repository with a few of my solutions to CodingGame's puzzles, competitions, and optimization challenges.
Keep in mind that playing CodinGame is something I do for fun when I have a few minutes to spare, so it should be no surprise that most of the solved puzzles in this repository belong to the "easy" category ðŸ˜Š.

However, a quick search in the community discussions and comments shows that some of the puzzles seem to be categorized more based on the code length of a solution, rather than the algorithmic complexity.
